        <h4>Waterfalls also help in turning waste that runs in the water into nutrients which help plants to grow. This is possible because as they pass over the rocks before flowing into the rivers and lakes, it enables bacterial growth which helps in the decomposition of the wastes</h4>

            <h2> Beauty in Motion
                The beauty of a waterfall lies in its motion. The water does not stay still. It flows, it dances, it leaps, and it roars. This constant movement is a sight to behold. Itâ€™s like watching an endless dance, with the water as the dancer and the rocks as the stage. The water, in its rush to reach the bottom, creates a mist that paints a rainbow when the sun shines. This sight can make you feel like you are in a fairy tale</h2>
